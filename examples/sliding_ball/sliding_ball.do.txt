Figure ref{fig:motion} show a particle with mass $m$ which can slide on the surface of 
the semicircle with radius $R$. The coefficient of friction, $\mu$ is constant. 
The particle is dropped at $\theta = 0$ with the angular velocity ($\theta '$) being zero. 
Applying Newton's law in the tigantial-direction we get:

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} = -\mu \left(\frac{d \theta}{d t}\right)^2 + \frac{g}{r}\left(cos \theta - \mu sin \theta\right)
label{eq:motion}
\end{align}
!et

By using the dimensionless time $\tau = \sqrt \frac{g}{R}$ Eq (ref{eq:motion}) can be written as:

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 \theta}{d \tau^2} = -\mu \left(\frac{d \theta}{d \tau}\right)^2 +cos \theta - \mu sin \theta
label{eq:motion_dimless}
\end{align}
!et

note that the friction force always work in the direction opposite to the direction of motion. 
Thus if $\frac{d \theta}{d \tau} \leq 0$ the governing equation is:

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 \theta}{d \tau^2} = \mu \left(\frac{d \theta}{d \tau}\right)^2 + cos \theta + \mu sin \theta
label{eq:motion_dimless_negative}
\end{align}
!et

The equation is valid for $0 \leq \theta \leq 180$. The assignment is to find the values of 
$\mu$ which make the particle turn and stop at certain $\theta$-values ($\theta_{turn}$, and $\theta_{stop}$).

=== Pen and paper ===
The following problems should be done using pen and paper: <linebreak>
_a_) Explain how you would find the value of $\mu$ which makes the ball turn at $\theta_{turn}=120^o=\frac{2}{3}\pi \, rad$, using shooting technique. What is the value of $\frac{d \theta}{d \tau}$ when the ball turns? Write Eq. (ref{eq:motion}) as a system of 1st order ODE's, and set up the $\phi$-function.

_a_) Explain how you would find the value of $\mu$ which makes the ball stop at $\theta_{stop}=100^o=\frac{2}{3}\pi \, rad$, using shooting technique. Write Eq. (ref{eq:motion_dimless}) and (ref{eq:motion_dimless_negative}) as a system of 1st order ODE's, and set up the $\phi$-function.

=== Programing ===
write python programs that solves _a_) and _b_) numerically. use the the _bokeh_ app to find appropriate starting values for $\mu$
