Figure ref{fig:motion} show a particle with mass $m$ which can slide on the surface of 
the semicircle with radius $R$. The coefficient of friction, $\mu$ is constant. 
The particle is dropped at $\theta = 0$ with the angular velocity ($\theta '$) being zero. 
Applying Newton's law in the tigantial-direction we get:

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} = + \frac{g}{r}\left(cos \theta - \mu sin \theta\right)
label{eq:motion}
\end{align}

The equation is valid for $0 \leq \theta \geq 180$. The assignment is to find the value of 
$\mu$ which make the particle stop at the lowest point of the semicircle ($\theta=90^o=\pi/2 \, rad$)
