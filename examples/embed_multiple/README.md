Example on autogenerated bokeh apps from IBPLOT "tags", embeded in a html template generated with doconce.

To see the embeded html page do as follows (in this directory):

1) compile the html template "template.html" (requires doconce):

doconce format html template.do.txt

2) start a bokeh server:

bokeh serve --allow-websocket-origin=localhost:8000

3) embed the app by running:

python Main.py

4) link the page to the url "http://localhost:8000/embed_template.html"

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Now navigate to the local url: "http://localhost:8000/embed_template.html"

in your browser.

If you are lazy you can run all the above commands by running the script:

make.sh (NB! this will start subprocesses)
